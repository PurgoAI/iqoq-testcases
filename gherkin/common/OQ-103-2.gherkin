Feature: Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Validation - OQ-103-2

  Scenario: Validate systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate
    Given the API endpoint is "${workspace_url}/api/2.0/sql/statements"
    When I send a POST request to validate_bp_hr_values
    Then the response should conform to the expected schema
    And less than 1% of blood pressure values should be null
    And less than 0.1% of heart rate values should be null
    And less than 2% of blood pressure values should be invalid
