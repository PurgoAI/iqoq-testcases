Feature: Validate Databricks Cluster Autoscaling Configuration
  In order to ensure compliance with autoscaling settings
  As a tester
  I want to validate that the Databricks cluster has the required auto-scaling configuration

  Scenario: Validate Cluster Autoscaling Configuration
    Given the Databricks API is available
    When I request the cluster autoscaling configuration
    Then the response schema should be null
    And the cluster should have the required auto-scaling configuration
