Feature: Validate Denial of Write Operations for Insufficient Permissions

  Scenario: Attempt to insert data into a protected table as a user with insufficient permissions
    Given the workspace URL is set
    When I check the cluster security configurations with a GET request to "/api/2.0/clusters/list"
    Then I should receive a successful response

    When I attempt a write operation with a POST request to "/api/2.0/sql/statements"
    Then the response schema should be null
    And the write operation should be denied due to insufficient permissions
