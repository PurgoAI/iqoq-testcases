Feature: Validate Databricks cluster worker node type and count for compliance
  Test Code: IQ-104-2

  Scenario: Ensure Databricks cluster has required worker node type and count
    Given the Databricks API at "${workspace_url}/api/2.0/clusters/get" is available
    When I send a GET request to retrieve cluster information
    Then the response should have a status code of 200
    And the response should contain a cluster configuration
    And the cluster configuration should have the required worker node type
    And the cluster configuration should have the required worker node count
