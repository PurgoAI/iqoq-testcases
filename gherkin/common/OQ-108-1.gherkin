Feature: Validate notebook sharing RBAC compliance for specific notebook OQ-108-1

  Scenario: Ensure proper access controls are enforced on the notebook
    Given the notebook ID is "${oq_108_1_notebook_id}"
    And the workspace URL is "${workspace_url}"
    When I check notebook permissions with GET request to "${workspace_url}/api/2.0/permissions/notebooks/${oq_108_1_notebook_id}"
    Then the response schema should be null
    And the response should indicate proper RBAC enforcement on the notebook
