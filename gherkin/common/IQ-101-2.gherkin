Feature: Validate Databricks runtime version to ensure LTS version is used

  Scenario: Validate LTS version for Databricks runtime
    Given the Databricks workspace API endpoint is set
    When I send a GET request to "${workspace_url}/api/2.1/clusters/list"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain a list of clusters
    And for each cluster in the response
      When I check the runtime version
      Then it should match the LTS version criteria
