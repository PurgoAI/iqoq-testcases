Feature: Validate Network Security Group (NSG) rules for proper security configuration

  Scenario: Ensure only necessary ports are open in NSG rules
    Given a subscription with an ID and a resource group with a workspace
    When I retrieve the workspace managed resource group
    And I retrieve the NSG rules for the effective resource group
    Then the NSG rules should only have necessary ports open according to the security configuration policy
